# KGTK Notebooks

**Welcome to the KGTK notebook tutorial!**

The goal of this tutorial repository is to introduce the functionality of KGTK to first-time users. The tutorial consists of several notebooks that demonstrate how to perform network analysis, graph profiling, knowledge enrichment, and embedding computation over a portion of the Wikidata knowledge graph. The tutorial notebooks can be found in the `tutorial` [folder](https://github.com/usc-isi-i2/kgtk-notebooks/tree/main/tutorial). All notebooks require minimum configuration and can be run locally or in Google Colab in a matter of a few minutes. The input data for the notebooks is stored in the `datasets` [folder](https://github.com/usc-isi-i2/kgtk-notebooks/tree/main/datasets). Basic understanding of knowledge graphs is sufficient for this tutorial. 

This repository has been created for the purpose of the KGTK tutorial presented at ISWC 2021. For more information on this tutorial and how to get in touch, see our [website](https://usc-isi-i2.github.io/kgtk-tutorial-iswc-2021/).
